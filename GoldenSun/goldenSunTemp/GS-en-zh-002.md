- Isaac

- 罗宾--Isaac

A Venus (earth elemental) Adept (user of Psynergy), who lives in Vale. During the boulder incident three years ago, he lost his father, Kyle, leaving his mother Dora as his only living relative.

主角，哈伊迪亚居民，地之“元素”使。无意间引发“元素”之星的抢夺事件而被迫承担起追讨“元素”之星、阻止“化学”复活的重任。由于黄金太阳的主角被设定为哑巴，性格、爱好等一切不明。旅途中实力迅速成长，精神之力开花。

-  杰拉德--Garet

A Mars (fire) Adept, who lives in Vale with Isaac.

罗宾的基友，火之“元素”使，哈伊迪亚村长的孙子，与罗宾一样被动地踏上旅程。性格直爽、鲁莽。一直想成为队伍领袖，但也承认冷静沉稳的罗宾更为适合。战场上作风强悍，与诅咒装备的相性不错。

- Ivan

- 伊万--Ivan

A Jupiter (wind) Adept, who was taken in and raised by Hammet of Kalay. He appears to have some connection to Hama of Lama Temple, but that\'s not expounded upon until the sequel.

大商人哈梅特的使者，风之“元素”使，有读心的特异能力。由于丢失重要的巫杖滞留在库阿普阿村，后因哈梅特被绑架无处容身而加入队伍。途中受到哈莫的真传学会了透视。年龄虽小但说话声音粗重……战斗时比较脆弱，需要重点保护。

A Mercury (water) Adept, who used her curative powers to tend to the sick in Imil during the epidemic they experienced. Alex was her apprentice.

伊美尔村的神官，水之“元素”使，守护水星燈塔的“水星种族”的后代。在水星燈塔由于受阻无法到达顶部而入队。基本印象是治愈系的少女，但屡有腹黑式台词。回复能力强大，同时最后的几个 BOSS 都是水弱点，发动水属性召唤效果也非常明显。

- Saturos and Menardi

- 萨丢罗斯--Saturos

Mars Adepts from the far north who seek to light the four lighthouses\' beacons. Three years ago, they attempted to gain access to the Elemental Stars in Sol Sanctum, but triggered a trap which not only killed the other members of their group, but that also unleashed the boulder upon Vale.

北极部族普罗库斯的战士，火之“元素”使。为解救濒临消失的家乡 and 火星燈塔而决心解放“化学”，之后成功地抢夺了“元素”之星并点燃了水星、金星燈塔。但在金星燈塔顶被罗宾一行追上，战败，坠入火口死亡。萨丢罗斯是封印篇最具人气的角色，水星燈塔与其交战的背景音乐堪称经典。

- Menardi

pass

与萨丢罗斯形影不离的搭档。出身、目的、行动都与萨丢罗斯一致。通常状态下是感情不外露的女人，只有对萨丢罗斯 and 自己的家乡普罗库斯时例外。游戏终盘借助金星燈塔能量开放，与萨丢罗斯一起化身为龙，但仍然不敌罗宾等人，结束了自己的生命。

A Mercury Adept, and previously Mia\'s apprentice. He, like Saturos and Menardi who he travels with, seeks to activate the beacons of the lighthouses.

米亚莉父亲的弟子，同样是“水星种族”的“元素”使。封印篇中加入萨丢罗斯阵营，但总是缺席关键场合。作为实力强大的“元素”使，阿莱克斯从未在战斗中出手，怀有不可告人的目的。

- Jenna

- 杰斯敏--Jenna

A Mars Adept, who lives in Vale. When Saturos and Menardi were unable to take the Mars Star from Isaac due to Mt. Aleph\'s sudden eruption, they kidnapped Jenna so that Isaac would follow them and they could acquire the star at a later date.

哈伊迪亚居民，火之“元素”使。3年前的灾难中失去了父母 and 哥哥。游戏初期与罗宾一起潜入索尔神殿发现“元素”之星，被萨丢罗斯劫持时意外发现了奇迹生还的哥哥。随后作为人质被带走，辗转于安加拉大陆。终盘先行离开金星燈塔，错过了与罗宾见面的机会。

- Felix

- 加西亚--Felix

A Venus Adept, and Jenna\'s brother. He fell into the river in Vale during the boulder incident, and was presumed dead when the boulder crashed into the water. However, Saturos and Menardi found him, and took him to their town to the far north. He assists them with their endeavor to ignite the beacons as repayment for saving his life, as well as for one other reason.

哈伊迪亚出身，地之“元素”使。3年前由于阿尔法山体滑坡而失踪，后被萨丢罗斯 and 梅娜蒂所救，在普罗库斯生活了3年，切身体会到世界面临的危机。游戏中作为萨丢罗斯阵营中的一员为复活“化学”而努力。终盘为了西芭的释放与萨、梅二人反目，最后为了救从燈塔坠落的西芭纵身跳入大海……

- Kraden

- 斯库莱塔--Kraden

An elderly scholar who came to Vale from Tolbi to further his study of Psynergy. He was kidnapped along with Jenna.

由巴比派遣至哈伊迪亚研究“化学”的学者。与罗宾一同潜入索尔神殿发现“元素”之星的秘密，后被萨丢罗斯 and 梅娜蒂劫持。经常以老人自居占别人便宜，但见到新奇事物会像小孩子一样兴奋。

- Babi

- 巴比--Babi

The ruler of Tolbi. Thanks to a mystical draught crafted in Lemuria that slows the aging process, Babi has been able to live for one-hundred and fifty years. However, that draught is running out. He ordered several scholars, including Kraden, to research Psynergy - the means by which the draught was created - in the hopes of being able to produce more. Also to the end of acquiring more draught, he ordered the construction of a lighthouse near Lalivero, with which he intended to look for Lemuria. Although he went there once before, he had been unable to find it again due to a thick fog that surrounds the Sea of Time in which Lemuria resides. As a third move toward locating Lemuria, Babi relinquished control of the Lemurian ship (which he had used when returning from there) to Isaac\'s group, asking them to search for the civilization.

托勒比领主，100多年前与义贼伦帕一起航海时发现了古代都市莱姆利亚。莱姆利亚的时间趋于静止，流逝速度比外界缓慢数倍，是真正的人间天堂。但定居一段时间后，巴比厌倦了莱姆利亚一潭死水的生活，偷了一艘大船 and 数甁延年益寿的秘药逃离，回到托勒比创建自己的国家。罗宾一行到达托勒比时，秘药已用尽，因此他将大船送予罗宾，期望他们能找到莱姆利亚重新带回秘药。在时代篇中，罗宾一行未能及时找到莱姆利亚，巴比抱憾去世。

- Sheba

- 西芭--Sheba

A Jupiter Adept who was taken in by Faran and his family in Lalivero. According to Faran and some of Lalivero\'s residents, Sheba literally fell from the sky, \"creating a massive depression in the [Venus] ruins\" - but miraculously, she wasn\'t harmed at all. Some consider her the \"holy child of Lalivero,\" while others find themselves skeptical of the tale of her arrival, as well as her power (Psynergy) being real. Babi ordered that Sheba be held hostage in Tolbi, so as to force Lalivero\'s citizens to work on his \"Babi Lighthouse\" being constructed near them. Saturos and Menardi then abducted her from Babi\'s palace so that they could use her to gain access to Jupiter Lighthouse (each lighthouse requires an Adept of its alignment in order to reach the beacon).

从天而降至拉里贝罗镇的少女，被奉为神子。巴比为强迫拉里贝罗居民为其卖力，长期将西芭扣留为人质。作为风之“元素”使，西芭可以自由进入木星燈塔，因此被萨丢罗斯带走。金星燈塔点燃后，由于剧烈的地震从燈塔顶坠入大海。

- The Wise One

- 贤者之石--The Wise One

A floating stone with one eye that possesses enormous Psynergetic power. It previously protected the Elemental Stars in Sol Sanctum.
